\section{Poroelasticity}

\subsection{Coupled Darcy Equation and Elasticity with Sub-iterations}

CMISSProblemFiniteElasticityDarcyType couples the finite elasticity equations and
Darcy's equation by solving each equation in term, iterating between the two equations
until convergence is reached. The full Darcy equations with velocity and pressure
are solved.

Darcy's equation is solved on the deformed geometry and the finite elasticity
constitutive relation has a dependence on the Darcy fluid pressure.

\subsection{Coupled Darcy Fluid Pressure and Elasticity}

The fully dynamic governing equations for poromechanics are described in \cite{coussy:2004}.
CMISSProblemfiniteElasticityFluidPressureType implements a static form of these equations
and strongly couples the equations
for finite elasticity to an equation describing the Darcy fluid pressure. Darcy's
equation describing the fluid flow is substituted into the mass conservation
equation to give:

\begin{equation}
\divergence{}{\pbrac{\dfrac{\tensor{K}}{\mu} \gradient{}{p}}} = 0
\end{equation}

A static form of the constitutive law developed by \cite{chapelle:2010} is implemented in the equations
