\subsection{Fluid-Structure Interaction}

\subsubsection{Fluid Model}

The physics in the fluid domain is described by the ALE form of the Navier-Stokes equations
\ie
\begin{align}
  \rho^{f}\pbrac{\delby{\vectr{v}}{t}+\pbrac{\dotprod{\vectr{v}}{\grad}}\pbrac{\vectr{v}-\vectr{w}}}&=\divergence{}{\tensor{\sigma}^{f}}+\rho^{f}\vectr{g}\\
    \divergence{}{\vectr{v}}&=0
\end{align}
where $\rho^{f}$ is the fluid density, $\vectr{v}$ is the fluid velocity,
$\vectr{w}$ is the fluid mesh velocity, $\tensor{\sigma}^{f}$ is the fluid
stress and $\vectr{g}$ is the gravity acceleration vector.

For Newtonian fluids, we have
\begin{equation}
  \tensor{\sigma}^{f}=-p^{f}\tensor{I}+\mu\pbrac{\gradient{}{\vectr{v}}+\transpose{\pbrac{\gradient{}{\vectr{v}}}}}
\end{equation}
where $p^{f}$ is the fluid pressure and $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity. 

\subsubsection{Solid Model}

The physics in the solid domain is described by a momentum balance
\begin{equation}
  \rho^{s}\deltwosqby{\vectr{u}}{t}=\divergence{}{\tensor{\sigma}^{s}}+\rho^{s}\vectr{g} 
\end{equation}
where $\rho^{s}$ is the solid density, $\vectr{u}$ is the solid displacement,
$\tensor{\sigma}^{s}$ is the solid stress and $\vectr{g}$ is the gravity
acceleration vector.
