Developer Login Scripts
=======================

This section describes the optional Unix login scripts that developers can use to setup their development environment.

.. contents::

Obtaining the Scripts
=====================

The development scripts are held in the utilities repository on GitHub i.e.,

   https://github.com/OpenCMISS/utilities

You will need to either fork and clone this repository from your GitHub organiziation or clone it from the main OpenCMISS organization i.e.

        cd <somewhere/you/keep/development/code>

and
        git clone git@github.com:username/utilities.git

or
        git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS/utilities.git

The login scripts will be located in the scripts directory of the cloned utilities repository.

Using the Scripts
=================

To use the script you must invoke the script from your login script. If you use a bash shell you will invoke it from your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile scripts in your home directory. If you use the csh or tcsh you will invoke it from your ~/.cshrc in your home directory. If you are unsure of what shell you are using examine the output from

   echo $SHELL

For bash users
--------------

To invoke it add the following commands to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile script.

::

   export OPENCMISS_ROOT=<path-to-where-you-put-your-OpenCMISS-files>
   if [ -r "$OPENCMISS_ROOT/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.sh" ]; then
       . $OPENCMISS_ROOT/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.sh
   fi

For csh/tcsh users
------------------

To invoke it add the following commands to your ~/.cshrc script.

::

   setenv OPENCMISS_ROOT <path-to-where-you-put-your-OpenCMISS-files>
   if ( -r "${OPENCMISS_ROOT}/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.csh" ) then
       source ${OPENCMISS_ROOT}/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.csh
   endif

Login Script Configuration Options
==================================

There are a number of options that can be use to configure the OpenCMISS developers login script and to customise its actions. To customise any actions of the login script simply set the variables appropriately before the login script is invoked e.g. For bash users

::

   export OPENCMISS_ROOT=<path-to-where-you-put-your-OpenCMISS-files>
   export OPENCMISS_TOOLCHAIN=gnu
   export OPENCMISS_MPI=mpich
   export OPENCMISS_BUILD_TYPE=debug
   export OPENCMISS_SETUP_TOTALVIEW=false
   if [ -r "$OPENCMISS_ROOT/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.sh" ]; then
       . $OPENCMISS_ROOT/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.sh
   fi

and for csh/tcsh users

::

   setenv OPENCMISS_ROOT <path-to-where-you-put-your-OpenCMISS-files>
   setenv OPENCMISS_TOOLCHAIN gnu
   setenv OPENCMISS_MPI mpich
   setenv OPENCMISS_BUILD_TYPE debug
   setenv OPENCMISS_SETUP_TOTALVIEW false
   if ( -r "${OPENCMISS_ROOT}/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.csh" ) then
       source ${OPENCMISS_ROOT}/utilities/scripts/opencmiss_developer.csh
   endif
